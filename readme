THE APPLICATION: backup9.sh

This is a bash script to create backups of the user documents of a linux system.  
The backup medium is a Flash Drive.  For convenience, a copy of the backup is allowed
to persist on the hard disk.  It endeavours to backup only a single tree from your
linux system, presumeably your data; not your system files.  By default, the tree is
/home/yourName/Documents.  Restricting the backup to only your data economizes.  

If you install an application in a place other than /home/yourName/Documents, it will
not be part of your backup.  Presumeably if you ever need to re-install an application
you can obtain it from the original source; so there is presumeably no need to use
resources to backup applications, linux itself, or other parts of your "system".

If there is something within your "system" that you might consider to be "data" and 
you want to have it backed up, just put it under the same tree that contains the 
rest of your data.  For example, bash scripts that you authored might be kept at 
/home/yourName/Documents/bashscripts instead of at /usr/bin

WHY YOU MIGHT WANT TO USE THIS BACKUP APPLICATION:

1. It is very simple.
2. It is transparent because it is merely a bash script.
3. It uses trusted tools such as tar and rsync.
4. It does not do incremental backups which might be inconvenient or opaque.
5. It leaves a copy of the backup on the hard disk for convenience.  
6. It can be invoked by cron.
7. It endeavours to backup only your data; not your system. 
8. Backups can also be manually copied from the hard disk to any medium other than
   the default Flash Drive.

TO INSTALL THIS BACKUP APPLICATION, FIRST MAKE IT EXECUTABLE:

chmod +x backup9.sh

TO RUN THIS BACKUP APPLICATION, RUN THIS SCRIPT AS FOLLOWS:

./backup9.sh

WHAT WILL HAPPEN WHEN YOU RUN THIS BACKUP APPLICATION:

On linux your folder which is named "/home/yourName/Documents" will be backed up to 
a place called "home/yourName/backups".

The backup will be a .tgz file, which means that it is both a tar archive and that it has
been gzipped.  tar is the original UNIX utility for archives.  gzipping makes the file
more compact.  Your newly created backup will have a file name that contains the
date and time stamp.  That backup and any others previously created will be backed up
to a Flash Drive at /media/usbFlash

A listing of the contents of the backup will be placed in /home/yourName/backup.log 

This backup application will cause every backup in /home/yourName/backups to be 
automatically be duplicated on the Flash Drive.  The Flash Drive will eventually become full.

From time to time, you should consider deleting older backups from the folder
/home/yourName/backups because failure to do so will cause the Flash Drive to become
full.  Of course a more cautious policy is to move older backups to some other backup
medium for more permanent archive storage.  This backup application will not help you do
that.  This backup application will only copy what is in /home/yourName/backups
to /media/usbFlash

To restore data from a backup, you can use a date and time stamped backup .tgz file from 
either /home/yourName/backups or from /media/usbFlash

A linux GUI tool such as Nautilus will be able to open and provide access to the data 
within the date and time stamped .tgz file that is your backup archive.
